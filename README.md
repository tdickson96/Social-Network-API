# <Social Network API>

## Description

![NoSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/NoSQL-MongoDB-yellowgreen)

This API focuses on user data for connecting through social networks. It is a fundamental part of full-stack applications and I did it to practice MongoDB back-end logic. It helped me bridge a deeper understanding of NoSQL and the subtles differences between SQL. I learned how to use Mongoose for NoSQL similar to Sequelize for SQL.
